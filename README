Explanation of the Purpose of Each File in the Repository:

1) final.py: Contains the "Member" class which defines the methods for managing customer's data, including retrieving member information, calculating balances, updating records, and handling payments.

2) people.txt: A txt file that stores initial data for the members. Each line includes a customer's name, membership status, license plate, vehicle type, and toll data across different toll locations. 

3) balance_sheet.json: A JSON file used to store and retrieve the lastest balance information for each customer. It is updated whenever payments are made or when balances are recalculated.
